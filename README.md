# Secretogen

**Currently kinda broken**

## Objective

This app lists out a bunch of randomly generated passwords based on a formula. Formulas such as `/w:/w-/n/n` would be translated in to `alpha:bravo-12` but obviously randomized.

## Future Improments
- [ ] Allow users to change the formula
- [ ] Refresh button
- [ ] Improve visual design
- [ ] Tap to copy generated passwords
- [ ] Disclaimer at the bottom saying that nothings is saved and such
